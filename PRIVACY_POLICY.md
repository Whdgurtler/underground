# Privacy Policy for Underground Toronto Navigator

**Last Updated: February 20, 2026**

## Introduction

Underground Toronto Navigator ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
The app collects and processes your device's location data to provide navigation services. This includes:
- **GPS coordinates** when above ground
- **Accelerometer and gyroscope data** when underground
- **Altitude information**
- **Location accuracy metrics**

**Important:** All location processing happens on your device. We do not transmit, store, or share your location data with our servers or any third parties.

### Device Sensors
The app accesses the following sensors:
- **GPS** - For outdoor positioning
- **Accelerometer** - For movement detection underground
- **Gyroscope** - For heading/direction detection

**Purpose:** These sensors enable the core functionality of estimating your position when GPS signals are unavailable underground.

## How We Use Information

Your information is used solely to:
1. Display your current location on the map
2. Track your movement path
3. Detect when you've gone underground
4. Estimate your position using sensor data
5. Provide navigation assistance

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
- All location data stays on your device
- No cloud synchronization
- No remote servers storing your data
- Data is temporary and cleared when you exit the app

### Cached Map Data
Google Maps may cache map tiles on your device for offline viewing. This is managed by Google's services according to their privacy policy.
