🏙️ ABOUT TORONTO'S PATH

The PATH is one of the world's largest underground pedestrian systems, spanning 30+ kilometers beneath Toronto's downtown core. With this app, you can navigate it confidently even without GPS signals.

🔬 HOW IT WORKS

Above ground, the app uses GPS satellites for accurate positioning. When you go underground (detected automatically based on GPS signal quality), it seamlessly switches to using your phone's motion sensors to estimate your position through advanced dead reckoning algorithms.

The accelerometer measures your movement, the gyroscope tracks your heading, and smart algorithms filter out noise to provide the most accurate underground position estimate possible.

Title: I built an app to navigate Toronto's PATH underground

Body:
Hey r/toronto! I created a free app called Underground Toronto Navigator that helps you navigate the PATH system when GPS signals aren't available.

The app uses your phone's accelerometer and gyroscope to estimate your position when you're underground. It automatically detects when you've lost GPS signal and switches modes.

It's completely free, no ads, and doesn't track you. All processing happens on your device.

Available on iOS and Android. Would love your feedback!
