## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Option 1: Deploy to Stores NOW (Fastest - 1 Day)
```bash
# Read this first (15 minutes)
cat DEPLOY_NOW.md

# Then follow the steps - you'll be submitting today!
```

### Option 2: Full Deployment Preparation (Best - 2-3 Days)
```bash
# Complete checklist
cat DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

# Read comprehensive guide
cat DEPLOYMENT.md

# Create amazing assets
cat APP_ICONS.md
```

### Option 3: Just Test the App First
```bash
# Install Flutter
flutter doctor

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on device
flutter run
```

## 💰 Cost to Deploy

| Item | Cost | When |
|------|------|------|
| **Google Play Store** | $25 | One-time |
| **Apple App Store** | $99 | Per year |
| **Google Maps API** | $0-20 | Per month |
| **Domain (optional)** | $12 | Per year |
| **TOTAL YEAR 1** | **$124-156** | - |

**Note:** Google Maps has generous free tier - will likely stay free!

## 📱 Store Submission Timeline

### Google Play Store
- ⚙️ **Build & configure:** 2-3 hours
- 📝 **Store listing:** 1-2 hours
- ⏰ **Review time:** 1-3 days (often same day!)
- ✅ **Total:** ~1 week max

### Apple App Store
- ⚙️ **Build & configure:** 2-3 hours
- 📝 **Store listing:** 1-2 hours
- ⏰ **Review time:** 1-7 days (avg 2-3 days)
- ✅ **Total:** ~1 week max

**Can submit to both on same day for coordinated launch!**

## 🔑 Critical Security Reminders

### ⚠️ NEVER COMMIT THESE TO GIT:
- ❌ `android/key.properties` (signing credentials)
- ❌ `android/app/*.jks` (keystore files)
- ❌ Google Maps API keys (already in manifest, don't expose)
- ❌ Passwords or secrets

### ✅ DO BACKUP THESE FILES:
- 💾 Android keystore (`.jks` file) - **YOU CAN NEVER RECOVER THIS!**
- 💾 Keystore passwords
- 💾 Apple Developer account credentials
- 💾 Google Maps API keys

**Recommended:** Use a password manager like 1Password, Bitwis, or LastPass.
